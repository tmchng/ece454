We set our tile size to be 256 x 16 (pixels), which allowed us to better utilize the L1 cache structure (64B line x 8 associative x 64 sets). This tile size also works well with our data structure, which is an array indexed by algorithm [i * dim + j]. It makes sure that we access nearby entries in order to reduce cache misses, and it also fits within the size of our L1 cache.

Note that both tiling and loop unrolling works better when the image dimension is larger (>=512), but they drag down CPE for smaller dimensions. Therefore, we treat smaller dimensions differently.

We tried various optimization techniques, including tiling, loop unrolling, and other loop optimizations. We tested different tiling sizes and number of loops to unroll, and eventually we arrived at a solution that achieved 2.8 mean speedup.
